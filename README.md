GifTastic

A dynamic web page that displays GIF images. 

This project was developed by a student learning the JavaScript and jQuery programming languages.

This application uses AJAX syntax within JavaScript code to call the GIPHY application programming interface(API).

The GIPHY.API may return a total of ten GIF images in JSON format to this application for display purposes. 

The application displays the GIF images on this web page for the user's amusement.  

There may be situations where less than ten images are displayed if the GIPHY.API does not find a total of ten

images for the requested animal search topic. 


Instructions for use: 

Click on any of the displayed images to animate the image. To stop the animation, click on the moving image.   

Additional animal buttons can be added to the page by entering the type of new animal in the text box below the 

"Add an animal" section and clicking the submit button. After the new button appears, click on it to see the ten 

GIF images for your submitted animal. 


Creating this application gave the developer jQuery, JavaScript, AJAX and JSON coding experience. 

This project is useful because it combines many JavaScript and jQuery concepts while working with an API in

practical and entertaining ways. 
 
Currently, only the original developer maintains and contributes to this project.
